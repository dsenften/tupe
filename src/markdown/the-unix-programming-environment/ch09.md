## Chapter 9: Document Preparation

One of the first applications of the UNIX system was editing and formatting documents; indeed, Bell Labs management was persuaded to buy the first PDP-11 hardware by promises of a document preparation system, not an operating system.
(Fortunately, they got more than they bargained for.)

The first formatting program was called `roff`.
It was small, fast, and easy to work with, so long as one was producing simple documents on a line printer.
The next formatter, `nroff`, by Joe Ossanna, was much more ambitious.
Rather than trying to provide every style of document that users might ever want, Ossanna made `nroff`programmable, so that many formatting tasks were handled by programming in the `nroff` language.

When a small typesetter was acquired in 1973, `nroff` was extended to handle the multiple sizes and fonts and the richer character set that the typesetter provided.
The new program was called `troff` (which by analogy to "en-roff" is pronounced "tee-roff.")
`nroff` and `troff` are basically the same program, and accept the same input language; `nroff` ignores commands like size changes that it cant honor.
We will talk mainly about `troff` but most of our comments apply to `nroff` as well, subject to the limitations of output devices.

The great strength of `troff` is the flexibility of the basic language and its programmability - it can be made to do almost any formatting task.
But the flexibility comes at a high price - `troff` is often astonishingly hard to use.
It is fair to say that almost all of the UNIX document preparation software is designed to cover up some part of naked `troff`.

One example is page layout - the general style of a document, what the titles, headings, and paragraphs look like, where the page numbers appear, how big the pages are, and so on.
These are not built in; they have to be programmed.
Rather than forcing each user to specify all of these details in every document, however, a package of standard formatting commands is provided.
A user of the package does not say "the next line is to be centered, in bigger letters, and a bold font."
Instead, the user says "the next line is a title," and the packaged definition of the style of a title is used.
Users talk about the logical components of a document - titles, headings, paragraphs, footnotes, etc. - instead of sizes, fonts, and positions.

Unfortunately, what started out as a "standard" package of formatting commands is no longer standard: there are several packages in wide use, plus many local variants.
We'll talk about two general-purpose packages here: `ms`, the original "standard", and `mm`, a newer version that is standard in System V.
We'll also describe the `man` package for printing manual pages.

We'll concentrate on `ms` because it is standard in the 7th Edition, it exemplifies all such packages, and it is powerful enough to do the job: we used it to typeset this book.
But we did have to extend it a bit, for example, by adding a command to handle words `in this font` in the text.

This experience is typical - the macro packages are adequate for many formatting tasks, but it is sometimes necessary to revert to the underlying `troff` commands.
We will describe only a small part of `troff` here.

Although `troff` provides the ability to control output format completely, it's far too hard to use for complicated material like mathematics, tables, and figures.
Each of these areas is just as difficult as page layout.
The solution to these problems takes a different form, however.
Instead of packages of formatting commands, there are special=purpose languages for mathematics, tables, and figures that make it easy to describe what is wanted.
Each is handled by a separate program that translates its language into `troff` commands.
The programs communicate through pipes.

These preprocessors are good examples of the UNIX approach at work - rather than making `troff` even bigger and more complicated than it is, separate programs cooperate with it.
(Of course, the language development tools described in Chapter 8 have been used to help with the implementations.)
We will describe two programs: `tbl`, which formats tables, and `eqn`, which formats mathematical expressions.

We will also try to give hints about document preparation and the supporting tools.
Our examples throughout the chapter will be a document describing the `hoc` language of Chapter 8 and a `hoc` manual page.
The document is printed as Appendix 2.
