## Chapter 7: UNIX System Calls

This chapter concentrates on the lowest level of interaction with the UNIX operating system - the system calls.
These are entries to the kernel.
They *are* the facilities that the operating system provides; everything else is built on top of them.

We will cover several major areas.
First is the I/O system, the foundation beneath library routines like `fopen` and `putc`.
We'll talk more about the file system as well, particularly directories and inodes.
Next comes a discussion of processes - how to run programs from within a program.
After that we will talk about signals and interrupts: what happens when you push the DELETE key, and how to handle that sensibly in a program.

As in Chapter 6, many of our examples are useful programs that were not part of the 7th Edition.
Even if they are not directly helpful to you, you should learn something from reading them, and they might suggest similar tools that you could build for your system.

Full details on the system calls are in Section 2 of the *UNIX Programmer's Manual*; this chapter describes the most important parts, but makes no pretense of completeness.
