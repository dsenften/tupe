## Chapter 5: Shell Programming

Although most users think of the shell as an interactive command interpreter, it is really a programming language in which each statement returns a command.
Because it must satisfy both the interactive and programming aspects of command execution, it is a strange language, shaped as much by history as by design.
The range of its application leads to an unsettling quantity of detail in the language, but you don't need to understand every nuance to use it effectively. 
This chapter explains the basics of shell programming by showing the evolution of some useful shell programs.
It is *not* a manual for the shell.
That is in the manual page `sh`(1) of the *Unix Programmer's Manual*, which you should have handy while you are reading.

With the shell, as with most commands, the details of behavior can often be most quickly discovered by experimentation.
The manual can be cryptic, and there is nothing better than a good example to clear things up.
For that reason, this chapter is organized around examples rather than shell features; it is a guide to *using* the shell for programming, rather than an encyclopedia of its capabilities.
We will talk not only about what the shell can do, but also about developing and writing shell programs, with an emphasis on testing ideas interactively.

When you've written a program, in the shell or any other language, it may be helpful enough that other people on your system would like to use it.
But the standards other people expect of a program are usually more rigorous than those you apply for yourself.
A major theme in shell programming is therefore making programs so robust they can handle improper input and give helpful information when things go wrong.

### 5.1 Customizing the `cal` command

One common use of a shell program is to enhance or to modify the user interface to a program.
As an example of a program that could stand enhancement, consider the `cal`(1) command:
```
$ cal
usage: cal [month] year            Good so far
$ cal october 1983
Bad argument                       Not so good
$ cal 10 1983
    October 1983
Su Mo Tu We Th Fr Sa
                   1
 2  3  4  5  6  7  8
 9 10 11 12 13 14 15
16 17 18 19 20 21 22
23 24 25 26 27 28 29
30 31
$
```
It's a nuisance that the month has to be provided numerically.
And, as it turns out, `cal 10` prints out the calendar for the entire year `10`, rather than for the current October, so you must always specify the year to get a calendar for a single month.

The important point here is that no matter what interface the `cal` command provides, you can change it without changing `cal` itself.
You can place a command in your private `bin` directory that converts a more convenient argument syntax into whatever the real `cal` requires.
You can even call your version `cal`, which means one less thing for you to remember.

The first issue is design: what should `cal` do?
Basically, we want `cal` to be reasonable.
It should recognize a month by name.
With two arguments, it should behave just as the old `cal` does, except for converting month names into numbers.
Given one argument, it should print the month or year's calendar as appropriate, and given zero arguments, it should print the *current* month's calendar, since that is certainly the most common use of a `cal` command.
So the problem is to decide how many arguments there are, then map them to what the standard `cal` wants.

The shell provides a `case` statement that is well suited for making such decisions:
```
case word in
pattern)	commands ;;
pattern)	commands ;;
...
esac
```
The *case* statement compares *word* to the *pattern*s from top to bottom, and performs the *commands* associated with the first, *pattern* that matches.
The patterns are written using the shell's pattern matching rules, slightly generalized from what is available for filename matching.
Each action is terminated by the double semicolon `;;`.
(The `;;` may be left off the last case, but we often leave it in for easy editing.)

Our version of `cal` decides how many arguments are present, processes alphabetic month names, then calls the real `cal`.
The shell variable `$#` holds the number of arguments that a shell file was called with; other special variables are listed in Table 5.1.

| variable | description                                               |
|----------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| `$#`     | the number of arguments                                   |
| `$*`     | all arguments to the shell                                |
| `$@`     | similar to `$*`; see Section 5.7                          |
| `$-`     | options supplied to the shell                             |
| `$?`     | return value of the last command executed                 |
| `$$`     | process id of the shell                                   |
| `$!`     | process id of the last command started with `&`           |
| `$HOME`  | default argument for `cd` command                         |
| `$IFS`   | list of characters that separate words in arguments       |
| `$MAIL`  | file that, when changed, triggers "you have mail" message |
| `$PATH`  | list of directories to search for commands                |
| `$PS1`   | prompt string, default `'$ '`                             |
| `$PS2`   | prompt string for continued command line, default `'> '`  |

```
$ cat cal
# cal:	nicer interface to /usr/bin/cal

case $# in 
0)	set `date`; m=$2; y=$6 ;;  # no args: use today
1)  m=$1; set `date`; y=$6 ;;  # 1 arg: use this year
*)  m=$1; y=$2 ;;              # 2+ args: month and year
esac

case $m in
[jJ]an*)    m=1  ;;
[fF]eb*)    m=2  ;;
[mM]ar*)    m=3  ;;
[aA]pr*)    m=4  ;;
[mM]ay*)    m=5  ;;
[jJ]un*)    m=6  ;;
[jJ]ul*)    m=7  ;;
[aA]ug*)    m=8  ;;
[sS]ep*)    m=9  ;;
[oO]ct*)    m=10 ;;
[nN]ov*)    m=11 ;;
[dD]ec*)    m=12 ;;
[1-9]|10|11|12)  ;;  # numeric month
*)    y=$m; m="" ;;  # plain year
esac

/usr/bin/cal $m $y   # run the real one
$
```
The first `case` checks the number of arguments, `$#`, and chooses the appropriate action.
The final `*` pattern in the first `case` is a catch-all: if the number of arguments is neither `0` nor `1`, the last case will be executed.
(Since patterns are scanned in order, the catch-all must be last.)
This sets `m` and `y` to the month and year - given two arguments, our `cal` is going to act the same as the original.

The first `case` statement has a couple of tricky lines containing
```
set `date`
```
Although not obvious from appearance, it is easy to see what this statement does by trying it:
```
$ date
Sat Oct 1 06:05:18 EDT 1983
$ set `date`
$ echo $1
Sat
$ echo $4
06:05:20
$
```
`set` is a shell built-in command that does too many things.
With no arguments, it shows the values of the environment, as we saw in Chapter 3.
Ordinary arguments reset the values of `$1`, `$2`, and so on.
So `set $(date)` sets `$1` to the day of the week, `$2` to the name of the month, and so on.
The first `case` in `cal`, therefore, sets the month and year from the current date if there are no arguments; if there's one argument, it's used as the month and the year is taken from the date.

`set` also recognizes several options, of which the most often used are `-v` and `-x`; they turn on echoing of commands as they are being processed by the shell.
These are indispensable for debugging complicated shell programs.

The remaining problem is to convert the month, if it is in textual form, into a number.
This is done by the second `case` statement, which should be largely self-explanatory.
The only twist is that the `|` character in `case` statement patterns, as in `egrep`, indicates an alternative: `big:small` matches either `big` or `small`.
Of course, these cases could also be written as `[jJ]an*` and so on.
The program accepts month names either in all lower case, because most commands accept lower case input, or with the first letter capitalized, because that is the format printed by `date`.
The rules for shell pattern matching are given in Table 5.2.

| pattern    | description |
|------------|-------------|
| `*`        |
| `?`        |
| `[ccc]`    |
| `"..."`    |
| `\c`       |
| `a&vert;b` |
| `/`        |
| `.`        |

The last two cases in the second `case` statement deal with a single argument that could be a year; recall that the first `case` statement assumed it was a month.
If it is a number that could be a month, it is left alone.
Otherwise, it is assumed to be a year.

Finally, the last line calls `/usr/bin/cal` (the real `cal`) with the converted arguments.
Our version of `cal` works as a newcomer might expect:
```
$ date
Sat Oct 1 06:09:55 EDT 1983
$ cal
    October 1983      
Su Mo Tu We Th Fr Sa  
                   1  
 2  3  4  5  6  7  8  
 9 10 11 12 13 14 15  
16 17 18 19 20 21 22  
23 24 25 26 27 28 29  
30 31                 
$ cal dec
   December 1983      
Su Mo Tu We Th Fr Sa  
             1  2  3  
 4  5  6  7  8  9 10  
11 12 13 14 15 16 17  
18 19 20 21 22 23 24  
25 26 27 28 29 30 31  
$
```
And `cal 1984` prints out the calendar for all of 1984.

Our enhanced `cal` program does the same job as the original, but in a simpler, easier-to-remember way.
We therefore chose to call it `cal`, rather than `calendar` (which is already a command) or something less mnemonic like `ncal` (new `cal`).
Leaving the name alone also has the advantage that users don't have to develop a new set of reflexes for printing a calendar.

Before we leave the `case` statement, it's worth a brief comment on why the shell's pattern matching rules are different from those in `ed` and its derivatives.
After all, two kinds of patterns means two sets of rules to learn and two pieces of code to process them.
Some of the differences are simply bad choices that were never fixed - for example, there is no reason except compatibility with a past now lost that `ed` uses `.` and the shell uses `?` for "match any character."
But sometimes the patterns do different jobs.
Regular expressions in the editor search for a string that can occur anywhere in a line; the special characters `^` and `$` are needed to *anchor* the search to the beginning and end of the line.
For filenames, however, we want the search anchored by default, since that is the most common case; having to write something like
```
$ ls ^?*.c$              Doesn't work this way
```
instead of
```
$ ls *.c
```
would be a nuisance.

### 5.2 Which command is `which`?

There are problems with making private versions of commands such as `cal`.
The most obvious is that if you are working with Mary and type `cal` while logged in as `mary`, you will get the standard `cal` instead of the new one, unless of course Mary has linked the new `cal` into her `bin` directory.
This can be confusing - recall that the error messages from the original `cal` are not very helpful - but is just an example of a general problem.
Since the shell searches for commands in a set of directories specified by `PATH`, it is always possible to get a version of a command other than the one you expect.
For instance, if you type a command, say `echo`, the pathname of the file that is actually run could be `./echo` or `/bin/echo` or `/usr/bin/echo` or something else, depending on the components of your `PATH` and where the files are.
It can be very confusing if there happens to be an executable file with the right name but the wrong behavior earlier in your search path than you expect.
Perhaps the most common is the `test` command, which we will discuss later: its name is such an obvious one for a temporary version of a program that the wrong `test` program gets called annoyingly often.
A command that reports which version of a program will be executed would provide a useful service.

One implementation is to loop over the directories in `PATH`, searching each for an executable file of the given name.
In Chapter 3, we used the `for` to loop over filenames and arguments.
Here, we want a loop that says
```
for i in each component of PATH
do
    if given name is in directory i
        print its full pathname
done
```
Because we can run any command inside backquotes (\`...\`), the obvious solution is to run `sed` over `$PATH`, converting colons into spaces.
We can test it out with our old friend `echo`:
```
$ echo $PATH
:/usr/you/bin:/bin:/usr/bin
$ echo $PATH sed 's/:/ /g'
 /usr/you/bin /bin /usr/bin
$ echo `echo $PATH 's/:/ /g'`
/usr/you/bin /bin /usr/bin
$
```
There is clearly a problem.
A null string in `PATH` is a synonym for `.`.
Converting the colons in `PATH` to blanks is therefore not good enough - the information about null components will be lost.
To generate the correct list of directories, we must convert a null component of `PATH` into a dot.
The null component could be in the middle or at either end of the string, so it takes a little work to catch all the cases:
```
$ echo $PATH | sed 's/^:/.:/
>                   s/::/:.:/g
>                   s/:$/:./
>                   s/:/ /g'
. /usr/you/bin /bin /usr/bin
$
```
We could have written this as four separate `sed` commands, but since `sed` does the substitution in order, one invocation can do it all.

Once we have the directory components of `PATH`, the `test`(1) command we've mentioned can tell us whether a file exists in each directory.
The `test` command is actually one of the clumsier UNIX programs.
For example, `test -r file` tests if `file` exists and can be read, and `test -w file` tests if `file` exists and can be written, but the 7th Edition provides no `test -x` (although System V and other versions do) which would otherwise be the one for us.
We'll have to settle for `test -f`, which tests that the file exists and is not a directory, in other words, is a regular file.
You should look over the manual page for `test` on your own system, however, since there are several versions in circulation.

Every command returns an *exit status* - a value returned to the shell to indicate what happened.
The exit status is a small integer; by convention `0` means "true" (the command ran successfully) and non-zero means "false" (the command ran unsuccessfully).
Note that this is opposite to the values of true and false in C.

Since many different values can all represent "false," the reason for failure is often encoded in the "false" exit status.
For example, `grep` returns `0` if there was a match, `1` if there was no match, and `2` if there was an error in the pattern or filenames.
Every program returns a status, although we usually aren't interested in its value.
`test` is unusual because its *sole* purpose is to return an exit status.
It produces no output and changes no files.

The shell stores the exit status of the last program in the variable `$?`:
```
$ cmp /usr/you/.profile /usr/you/.profile
                                           No output, they're the same
$ echo $?
0                                          Zero implies ran O.K.: files identical
$ cmp /usr/you/.profile /usr/mary/.profile
/usr/you/.profile /usr/mary/.profile differ: char 6, line 3
echo $?
1                                          Non-zero means files were different
$
```
A few commands, such as `cmp` and `grep`, have an option `-s` that causes them to exit with an appropriate status but suppress all output.

The shell's `if` statement runs commands based on the exit status of a command, as in
```
if command
then
    commands if condition true
else
    commands if condition false
fi
```
The location of the newlines is important: `fi`, `then`, and `else` are recognized only after a newline or a semicolon.
The `else` part is optional.

The `if` statement always runs a command - the condition - whereas the `case` statement does pattern matching directly in the shell.
In some UNIX versions, including System V, `test` is a shell built-in function so an `if` and a `test` will run as fast as a `case`.
If `test` isn't built in, `case` statements are more efficient than `if` statements, and should be used for any pattern matching:
```
case "$1" in
hello)    command
esac
```
will be faster than
```
if test "$1" = hello     Slower unless test is a shell built-in
then
          command
fi
```
That is one reason why we sometimes use `case` statements in the shell for testing things that would be done with an `if` statement in most programming languages.
A `case` statement, on the other hand, can't easily determine whether a file has read permissions; that is better done with a `test` and an `if`.

So now the pieces are in place for the first version of the command `which`, to report which file corresponds to a command:
```
$ cat which
# which cmd:	which cmd in PATH is executed, version 1

case $# in
0)    echo 'Usage: which command' 1>&2; exit 2
esac
for i in `echo $PATH | sed 's/^:/.:/
                            s/::/:.:/g
                            s/:$/:./
                            s/:/ /g'`
do
    if test -f $i/$1        # use test -x if you can
    then
        echo $i/$1
        exit 0              # found it
    fi
done
exit 1                      # not found
$
```
Let's test it:
```
$ cx which               Make it executable
$ which which
./which
$ which ed
/bin/ed
$ mv which /usr/you/bin
$ which which
/usr/you/bin/which
$
```
The initial `case` statement is just error-checking.
Notice the redirection `1>&2` on the `echo` so the error message doesn't vanish down a pipe.
The shell built-in command `exit` can be used to return an exit status.
We wrote `exit 2 ` to return an error status if the command didn't work, `exit 1` if it couldn't find the file, and `exit 0` if it found one.
If there is no explicit `exit` statement, the exit status from a shell file is the status of the last command executed.

What happens if you have a program called `test` in the current directory?
(We're assuming that `test` is not a shell built-in.)
```
$ wcho `echo hello` >test          Make a fake test
$ cx test                          Make it executable
$ which which                      Try which now
hello                              Fails!
./which
$
```
More error-checking is called for.
You could run `which` (if there weren't a `test` in the current directory!) to find out the full pathname for `test`, and specify it explicitly.
But that is unsatisfactory: `test` may be in different directories on different systems, and `which` also depends on `sed` and `echo`, so we should specify their pathnames too.
There is a simpler solution: fix `PATH` in the shell file, so it only looks in `/bin` and `/usr/bin` for commands.
Of course, for the `which` command only, you have to save the old `PATH` for determining the sequence of directories to be searched.

```
$ cat which
# which cmd:	which cmd in PATH is executed, final version

opath=$PATH
PATH=/bin:/usr/bin

case $# in
0)    echo 'Usage: which command' 1>&2; exit 2
esac

for i in `echo $opath | sed 's/^:/.:/
                             s/::/:.:/g
                             s/:$/:./
                             s/:/ /g'`
do
    if test -f $i/$1        # this is /bin/test
    then                    # or /usr/bin/test only
        echo $i/$1
        exit 0              # found it
    fi
done
exit 1                      # not found
$
```
`which` now works even if there is a spurious `test` (or `sed` or `echo`) along the search path.
```
$ ls -l test
-rwxrwxrwx 1 you			11 Oct	1 06:55	test
$ which which
/usr/you/bin/which
$ which test
./test
$ rm test
$ which test
/bin/test
$
```

The shell provides two other operators for combining commands, `||` and `&&`, that are often more compact and convenient than the `if` statement.
For example, `||` can replace some `if` statements:
```
test -f filename || echo file filename doesnot exist
```
is equivalent to
```
if test ! -f filename
then
    echo file filename does not exist
fi
```
The operator `||`, despite appearances, has nothing to do with pipes - it is a conditional operator meaning `OR`.
The command to the left of `||` is executed.
If its exit status is zero (success), the command to the right of `||` is ignored.
If the left side returns non-zero (failure), the right side is executed and the value of the entire expression is the exit status of the right side.
In other words, `||` is a left conditional `OR` operator that does not execute its right-hand command if the left one succeeds.
The corresponding `&&` conditional is `AND`; it executes its right-hand command only if the left one succeeds.
