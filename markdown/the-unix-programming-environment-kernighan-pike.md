## Chapter 4: Filters

There is a large family of UNIX programs that read some input, perform a simple transformation on it, and write some output.
Examples include `grep` and `tail` to select part of the input, `sort` to sort it, `wc` to count it, and so on.
Such programs are called *filters*.

This chapter discusses the most frequently used filters.
We begin with `grep`, concentrating on patterns more complicated than those illustrated in Chapter 1.
We will also present two other members of the `grep` family, `egrep` and `fgrep`.

The next section briefly describes a few other useful filters, including `tr` for character transliteration, `dd` for dealing with data from other systems, and `uniq` for detecting repeated text lines.
`sort` is also presented in more detail than in Chapter 1.

The remainder of the chapter is devoted to two general purpose "data transformers" or "programmable filters."
They are called programmable because the particular transformation is expressed as a program in a simple programming language.
Different programs can produce very different transformations.

The programs are `sed` which stands for *stream editor*, and `awk`, named after its authors.
Both are derived from a generalization of `grep`:
```
$ program pattern-action filenames ...
```
scans the files in sequence, looking for lines that match a pattern; when one is found a corresponding action is performed.
For `grep`, the pattern is a regular expression as in `ed`, and the default action is to print each line that matches the pattern.

`sed` and `awk` generalize both the patterns and the actions.
`sed` is a derivative of `ed` that takes a "program" of editor commands and streams data from the files past them, doing the commands of the program on every line.
`awk` is not as convenient for text substitution as `sed` is, but it includes arithmetic, variables, built-in functions, and a programming language that looks quite a bit like C.
This chapter doesn't have the complete story on either program; Volume 2B of the *UNIX Programmer's Manual* has tutorials on both.

### 4.1 The `grep` Family

We mentioned `grep` briefly in Chapter 1, and have used it in examples since then.
```
$ grep pattern filenames
```
searches the named files or the standard input and prints each line that contains an instance of the *pattern*.
`grep` is invaluable for finding occurrences of variables in programs or words in documents, or for selecting parts of the output of a program:
```
$ grep -n variable *.[ch]             Locate variable in C source code
$ grep From $MAIL                     Print message headers in mailbox
$ grep From $MAIL | grep -v mary      Headers that didn't come from mary
$ grep -y mary $HOME/lib/phone-book		Find mary's phone number
$ who | grep mary                     See if mary is logged in
$ ls | grep -v temp                   Filenames that don't contain temp
```
The option `-n` prints line numbers, `-v` inverts the since of the test, and `-y` makes lower case letters in the pattern match letters of either case in the file (upper case still matches only upper case).

In all the examples we've seen so far, `grep` has looked for ordinary strings of letters and numbers.
But `grep` can actually search for much more complicated patterns: `grep` was originally created (in an evening) by straightforward surgery on `ed`.

Regular expressions are specified by giving special meaning to certain characters, just like the `*`, etc., used by the shell.
There are a few more metacharacters, and, regrettably, differences in meanings.
Table 4.1 shows all the regular expression metacharacters but we will review them briefly here.

The metacharacters `^` and `$` "anchor" the pattern to the beginning (`^`) or end (`$`) of the line.
For example
```
$ grep 'From' $MAIL
```
locates lines containing `From` in your mailbox, but
```
$ grep '^From' $MAIL
```
prints lines that *begin* with `From`, which are more likely to be message header lines.
Regular expression metacharacters overlap with shell metacharacters, so it's always a good idea to enclose `grep` patterns in single quotes.

`grep` supports *character classes* much like those in the shell, so `[a-z]` matches any lower case letter.
But there are differences; if a `grep` character class begins with a ~circumflex~ carat `^`, the pattern matches any character *except* those in the class.
Therefore, `[^0-9]` matches any non-digit.
Also, in the shell a backslash protects `]` and `-` in a character class, but `grep` and `ed` require that these characters appear where their meaning is unambiguous.
For example, `[][-]` (sic) matches either an opening or closing square bracket or a minus sign.

A period `.` is equivalent to the shell's `?`: it matches any character.
(The period is probably the character with the most different meanings to different UNIX programs.)



| character  | meaning                                                     |
|------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| `c`        | any non-special character `c` matches itself                |
| `]c`       | turn off any special meaning of character `\c`              |
| `^`        | beginning of line                                           |
| `$`        | end of line                                                 |
| `.`        | any single character                                        |
| `[...]`    | any one of characters in `...`; ranges like `a-z` are legal |
| `[^...]`   | any single of character not in `...`; ranges are legal      |
| `\n`       | what the `n`'th `\(...\)` matched (`grep` only)             |
| `r*`       | zero or more occurrences of `r`                             |
| `r+`       | one or more occurrences of `r` (`egrep` only)               |
| `r?`       | zero or more occurrences of `r` (`egrep` only)              |
| `r1r2`     | `r1` followed by `r2`                                       |
| `r1piper2` | `r1` or `r2` (`egrep` only)                                 |
| `\(r\)`    | tagged regular expression `r` (`grep` only); can be nested  |
| `(r)`      | regular expression `r` (`egrep` only); can be nested        |
